This is a simple web application where I am hosting a static & live feed.
Pretty much you'll see a video of me back from 2006 when my band tried our luck at a Battle of the Bands.
I'm also live-streaming from my webcam with the help of VLC Player & Ngrok.

The website is <a href="https://newappv.herokuapp.com">here</a>.

I used for this project the following:
<ul>
	<li>Python</li>
	<li>Ananconda</li>
	<li>Flask Framework</li>
	<li>OAuth: Google</li>
	<li>VLC Player</li>
	<li>Ngrok</li>
	<li>Heroku</li>
</ul>

While developing this application, I had to learn Python fundamentals and
Web Development using the Flask Framework.
